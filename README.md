## Development of a web application and database to enable monitoring patients with cervical mobility problems

This web application allows their users to access a database with a list of patients and their cervical movement records, which are measured using a comercial sensor (Werium Basic Pro) which generates CSV archives that can be browsed and stored along with the rest of the patients records. This data can be viewed in graphical form, allowing doctors and physiotherapists to view patients evolution with time as well as daily measurements.
