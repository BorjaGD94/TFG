## Development of a web application and database to enable monitoring patients with cervical mobility problems

This web application allows their users to access a database with a list of patients and their cervical movement records, which are taken using a comercial sensor (Werium Basic Pro) that generates CSV archives that can be read by the web application. This data can be viewed in graphical form, allowing doctors and physiotherapists to view patients evolution with time as well as daily measurements.
